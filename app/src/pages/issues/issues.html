  <h2>Scanning Barcodes</h2>
  <p>
  The barcode scanner does not work well when scanning bright screens.
  If you are having trouble scanning hackers' QR codes,
  please ask them to reduce their screen brightness.

  <h2>Accessing the Scanner</h2>
  <p>
  When you try to access the camera, the app only checks
  whether it already has permission to access the camera.
  If it doesn't, it will simply abort the scan.
  Before you use the scanner for the first time,
  please give the app permission to access the camera.
